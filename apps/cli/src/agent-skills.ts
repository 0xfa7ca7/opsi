# KLOPSI orchestrator

Use this skill as the main entry point for Slovenian public-data work with the \`klopsi\` CLI. Generated for \`klopsi\` ${version}.

## Route requests

1. Read [klopsi-shared](../klopsi-shared/SKILL.md).
2. Classify the request and load the smallest relevant skill from this table.
3. Load more than one domain skill only when the workflow crosses domains.
4. Execute the documented \`klopsi\` commands and summarize structured results.

| Intent | Skill |
| --- | --- |
${routes}

Do not pass \`/klopsi\`, \`@klopsi\`, or \`$klopsi\` to the shell. Those are host-specific ways to invoke this skill; shell commands begin with \`klopsi\`.

## End-to-end workflows

### ${definition.workflows[0]}

1. Search with a bounded result set, inspect the selected dataset and resource, then preview and validate the chosen input.
2. Download it to a new destination when local processing is needed; then use \`--offline\` for the local validation, query, conversion, and provenance steps.
3. Keep queries read-only and bounded, authorize any overwrite, and run \`provenance verify\` for important outputs.

### ${definition.workflows[1]}

1. Inspect the canonical WFS resource, list its layers, and inspect the selected layer schema.
2. Preview or count a finite selection before exporting a bounded CSV; preserve the CLI's network safeguards and never send WFS transactions.
3. Verify the exported artifact with provenance.

### ${definition.workflows[2]}

1. Prepare a bounded local artifact with analysis or WFS export, then verify available provenance.
2. Choose \`klopsi-static-dashboard\` for a concise printable board or \`klopsi-interactive-dashboard\` for bounded exploration across linked views.
3. Generate one self-contained offline HTML file, disclose reductions and verification status, and run the shared dashboard verifier before handoff.

### ${definition.workflows[3]}

1. Run \`klopsi agent setup --dry-run\` to inspect the planned selection and repertoire.
2. With explicit authorization, select the intended host with \`--agent <id>\` and use \`--yes\` for non-interactive installation.
3. Confirm the result includes the complete reported repertoire; use \`generate-skills\` only when a portable skill tree is needed rather than an installation.

## Routing rules

- Prefer the narrowest skill that fully handles the request.
- Inspect \`klopsi <command> --help\` if runtime syntax might differ from the generated reference.
- Keep identifiers returned by the CLI exact; do not invent dataset or resource IDs.
- Return a concise result grounded in stdout, stderr, and the process exit status.

function renderShared(definition: AgentSkillDefinition, version: string): string {

# KLOPSI shared execution contract

Read this before using any KLOPSI domain skill. Generated for \`klopsi\` ${version}.

## Install and discover

\`\`\`sh
npm install --global klopsi
klopsi --version
klopsi --help
klopsi <command> --help
\`\`\`

Use the installed CLI as the source of truth when its help differs from generated skill text.

## Structured output

- Prefer \`--json\` for one bounded result envelope or \`--ndjson\` for streamed records.
- Use \`--fields\` and command-specific row limits to keep agent context small.
- Read result data from stdout, diagnostics from stderr, and the exit status as the authoritative success signal.
- Inspect the structured \`error.code\` together with the exit status before choosing remediation.
- Never parse a human-readable table when structured output is available.

## Default decision sequence

1. Resolve a local path, a local:file reference, or an exact \`opsi:resource:\` reference.
2. Inspect unknown inputs, then preview a bounded sample and validate when the next operation depends on content integrity.
3. Download provider data before local-only work, then use \`--offline\` for the remaining local steps when network access is unavailable or unwanted.
4. Perform the requested bounded operation and verify important artifacts with provenance.

## Input and selector choices

- Use a local path for data already on disk and a canonical \`opsi:resource:\` reference for provider data; do not invent IDs or references.
- Use one \`--entry\` or \`--record-path\` reported by resource inspect or the relevant operation's structured error/output; resource inspect can surface ZIP entries and XML record paths.
- Without \`--sheet\`, XLSX resource preview, validate, or query emits \`SHEET_REQUIRED\` with \`context.sheets\` and a suggestion; use one listed sheet.

## Formats and outputs

- Supported tabular workflow formats include JSON, NDJSON, CSV, TSV, XLSX, Parquet, ZIP, and XML when their selected content is supported.
- Choose \`--json\` for one bounded envelope, \`--ndjson\` for records, and command-specific \`--output\` for a persisted artifact; use spreadsheet-safe output when needed.

## Presentation artifacts

- Read [the dashboard presentation contract](references/presentation-contract.md) before creating a static or interactive HTML presentation.
- Run \`node ../klopsi-shared/scripts/verify-dashboard.mjs <dashboard.html> --mode <static|interactive> --json\` and repair every finding before handoff.
- Passing the dashboard verifier is presentation evidence, not official artifact provenance; use \`klopsi provenance verify\` for provenance claims.

## Global options

${globalOptionsTable()}

## Network and offline behavior

- Pass \`--offline\` when network access is prohibited. Do not imply that an uncached request can succeed offline.
- Preserve HTTPS, DNS, redirect, timeout, download-size, query, memory, thread, cell, and output bounds.
- Use \`--allow-insecure-http\` or \`--allow-private-network\` only after the user explicitly accepts that invocation's risk.
- Do not blindly retry invalid input, unsupported operations, validation failures, or integrity failures.

## Safety

${definition.safety.map((item) => `- ${item}`).join("\n")}

## Confirm mutations

- Confirm before \`cache clear\` or \`cache prune\` unless the user already requested that exact operation.
- Confirm before using \`--force\` to replace an artifact unless that exact overwrite is already authorized.
- Do not persist secret-like configuration values; use the environment for secrets.

## Exit categories

| Exit | Meaning | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Success | Use the structured result. |
| 1 | Internal failure | Report diagnostics; retry only when evidence suggests a transient failure. |
| 2 | Invalid input or configuration | Correct the command or configuration before retrying. |
| 3 | Not found | Check the exact dataset, resource, or local path. |
| 4 | Provider or network failure | Respect offline mode and retry only transient failures. |
| 5 | Unsupported operation | Choose a supported provider, format, or installed native dependency. |
| 6 | Validation or integrity failure | Report issues and repair or replace the input. |
| 7 | Query failure | Correct the bounded read-only SQL or resource input. |
| 8 | Partial success | Report successes and failures separately. |

## Shell discipline

- Quote paths and user-provided values safely.
- Never print credentials, authorization headers, cookies, or secret environment values.
- Use canonical references returned by \`klopsi\` when available.
