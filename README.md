# klopsi

_komandna linija za OPSI_

**built for people, scripts, and agents**

Search Slovenia's [OPSI](https://podatki.gov.si/) catalogue, inspect and download resources, safely select ZIP/XML data, query read-only WFS services, and analyze tabular data locally with DuckDB. Structured output, bounded operations, and built-in help make `klopsi` straightforward to use from a terminal, an automated workflow, or a coding agent.

## Why klopsi?

- **One end-to-end workflow.** Discover a dataset, inspect its resources, download the data, validate it, query it, and convert it without switching tools.
- **Predictable automation.** Choose JSON, NDJSON, CSV, or TSV output; keep result data on stdout; and branch on stable exit categories.
- **Agent-friendly interface.** Discover commands with `--help`, request compact machine-readable results with `--json` and `--fields`, and handle failures without parsing human-readable messages.
- **Safe local analysis.** Downloads are bounded and verified, queries are read-only and sandboxed, and generated artifacts include provenance records.
- **Useful offline.** Reuse cached catalogue metadata and content without allowing accidental network requests.
- **Fast repeated queries.** Transparently reuse immutable DuckDB staging databases for unchanged content, with a separate TTL/LRU storage budget.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Node.js 24 or later
- Linux x64 with glibc, macOS arm64, or Windows x64 for supported releases

KLOPSI's `@duckdb/node-api` binding is an optional native dependency. Catalogue, configuration, and completion commands remain available when a compatible binding cannot be installed; native data commands return `DUCKDB_UNAVAILABLE` with remediation guidance. The external DuckDB CLI is a separate optional dependency used only by `klopsi duckdb`.

### Install from npm

Install the supported release globally:

```sh
npm install --global klopsi
```

Confirm the installation:

```sh
klopsi --version
klopsi doctor --offline
```

For project-local use, run `npm install klopsi` and invoke the CLI with `npx klopsi`.

### Install from source

To build the current source checkout instead:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0xfa7ca7/klopsi.git klopsi
cd klopsi
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.11.0 --activate
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
npm install --global ./apps/cli
```

See the [installation guide](docs/installation.md) for supported targets, release verification, and troubleshooting.

Run bare `klopsi` for guided getting-started steps, example discovery commands, environment checks, and an invitation to install KLOPSI skills for detected AI agents. Use `klopsi --help` when you want the complete command reference instead.

## Quick start

Search the catalogue and inspect a dataset:

```sh
klopsi search promet --limit 5
klopsi dataset show DATASET_ID --json
klopsi dataset resources DATASET_ID
```

Replace `DATASET_ID` with an ID returned by `search`, then download one of its resources:

```sh
klopsi download opsi:resource:RESOURCE_ID --output ./downloads
```

Replace `RESOURCE_ID` with an ID returned by `dataset resources`. Use the downloaded filename to preview, validate, and query the data:

```sh
klopsi resource preview ./downloads/data.csv --limit 10
klopsi validate ./downloads/data.csv --json
klopsi query ./downloads/data.csv \
  --sql "select * from data limit 10" \
  --json
```

Compare two refreshes by a unique, non-null key to see schema and row changes rather
than only a changed file hash. This command is experimental:

```sh
klopsi diff ./downloads/data-2025.csv ./downloads/data-2026.parquet --key id
klopsi diff old.csv new.csv --key municipality year --limit 5 --json
```

Open the same prepared table `data` in a DuckDB dataset workbench. The writable workbench is session-local, while KLOPSI attaches the staged source read-only. Install the external DuckDB CLI explicitly when it is not already available:

```sh
klopsi duckdb open ./downloads/data.csv
klopsi duckdb open ./results.parquet --install
klopsi duckdb install --yes
```

Convert the resource to Parquet and verify its provenance:

```sh
klopsi convert ./downloads/data.csv \
  --to parquet \
  --output ./downloads/data.parquet

klopsi provenance verify ./downloads/data.parquet --json
```

Run `klopsi --help` or read the [complete command reference](docs/commands.md) for every command, option, and exit category.

`klopsi dataset list` reads a compact, centrally published catalogue snapshot by default. Use `--refresh` to check for a current snapshot or `--live` to query OPSI directly. The command never silently falls back to a live query. See the [catalogue service guide](docs/catalogue-service.md) for details.

## Working with data

`klopsi` can inspect and validate resilient CSV/TSV-style data (UTF-8/UTF-16, comma/tab/semicolon/pipe), JSON, NDJSON, XLSX, Parquet, bounded XML records, and one safely selected data entry inside a ZIP. Use `--entry` for ambiguous archives and `--record-path` for ambiguous XML. Read-only WFS workflows expose layers, schemas, bounded previews, counts, and CSV exports without leaving KLOPSI.

Experimental `klopsi diff` resolves any two of those supported tabular inputs, stages
them together temporarily, and compares rows with an explicit composite key. It
reports schema changes plus exact added, removed, changed, and unchanged counts.
Examples are ordered by the key and bounded to 10 per class by default (100 maximum).
Missing, differently typed, null, or duplicate keys fail explicitly because a
many-to-many join would produce misleading counts.

The first query or DuckDB UI session for a source imports it into a rebuildable DuckDB stage with one table named `data`; later operations over identical bytes and the same XLSX sheet reuse that stage. JSON metadata reports `cache.status` as `miss`, `hit`, or `bypass`. The derived cache defaults to a 10 GB budget and 30-day sliding lifetime, and its entries are visible through `klopsi cache info|list|verify|prune|clear`. Derived eviction never removes raw downloads or catalogue data merely to satisfy the DuckDB budget.

| Capability | Behavior                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Preview    | Reads a bounded number of rows from local files or provider resources           |
| Validate   | Reports typed issues and recommendations for data or metadata                   |
| Diff       | Reports exact keyed row/schema changes with deterministic bounded samples       |
| Query      | Accepts one bounded, read-only `SELECT`, `WITH … SELECT`, or `VALUES` statement |
| Convert    | Writes CSV, TSV, JSON, NDJSON, XLSX, or Parquet atomically                      |
| Provenance | Records and verifies the source, transformation, and SHA-256 digest             |

XLSX formulas are treated as data and are never executed. See [format support](docs/formats.md) for detection rules, limits, worksheet handling, and extension guidance.

## Automation and structured output

Human-readable tables are the interactive default. For scripts and pipelines, select `--json`, `--ndjson`, `--csv`, `--tsv`, or `--output-format`:

```sh
klopsi search promet --fields id,title --json --limit 5
klopsi dataset list --ndjson
NO_COLOR=1 klopsi providers list --csv
```

JSON responses use a stable `{ schemaVersion, data, meta, error? }` envelope. Query metadata includes the transparent DuckDB stage-cache status. Results go to stdout; warnings and diagnostics go to stderr. Stable exit categories let scripts distinguish invalid input, missing data, provider failures, validation errors, query failures, and partial success without parsing messages.

## Using klopsi with agents

The repository ships a complete repertoire of [Agent Skills](docs/skills.md): a main `klopsi` orchestrator, shared safety guidance, and focused skills for every command area. After installing the CLI, let KLOPSI detect supported agent hosts and install the complete repertoire globally:

```sh
klopsi agent setup
```

Interactive setup asks for confirmation when more than one host is detected. For unattended setup, accept the detected hosts with `--yes`, target explicit installer IDs with `--agent codex claude-code`, or target every globally installable profile with `--all`. If detection finds no host, choose one explicitly with `--agent` or `--all`; `--yes` never expands an empty detection result. Use `--dry-run` to preview the plan. Setup always copies skills durably into agent directories because its generated source is temporary. Setup uses the pinned installer shipped with KLOPSI, does not invoke `npx`, does not offer unrelated remote skills, and does not create `.agents` or `skills-lock.json` in the current project.

Human setup output uses clear detected-agent, installed-skill, detail, and next-step sections, with restrained color on interactive terminals and plain text under `NO_COLOR` or redirection. Structured output keeps the stable result shape for scripts and agents.

To refresh a stale repertoire, rerun `klopsi agent setup`; preview the intended update with `--dry-run`, choose a host with `--agent`, and verify that the installed host contains every skill reported by the structured setup output.

For a project-local installation, use a compatible Agent Skills installer directly:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/0xfa7ca7/klopsi
```

Or install only a focused skill and its `klopsi-shared` prerequisite:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/0xfa7ca7/klopsi/tree/main/skills/klopsi-analysis
npx skills add https://github.com/0xfa7ca7/klopsi/tree/main/skills/klopsi-dataset-workbench
npx skills add https://github.com/0xfa7ca7/klopsi/tree/main/skills/klopsi-shared
```

The dataset workbench skill represents prepared data as a database for SQL, profiles, tables, and charts. It can also offer to create a DuckDB UI notebook named `Example queries` through supported UI controls.

Prepared local data can be presented through two agent-authored and contract-verified workflow skills. Both create one self-contained offline HTML artifact: choose the static skill for a concise printable board or the interactive skill for bounded exploration across linked views. Install either focused workflow together with its shared contract and verifier:

```sh
npx skills add https://github.com/0xfa7ca7/klopsi/tree/main/skills/klopsi-static-dashboard
npx skills add https://github.com/0xfa7ca7/klopsi/tree/main/skills/klopsi-interactive-dashboard
npx skills add https://github.com/0xfa7ca7/klopsi/tree/main/skills/klopsi-shared
```

This first version is agent-authored and contract-verified; it does not claim deterministic HTML rendering by the CLI. [Issue #28](https://github.com/0xfa7ca7/klopsi/issues/28) tracks a future deterministic CLI-backed renderer.

Compatible agent hosts select `klopsi` automatically from your request. Depending on the host, you may also invoke the main orchestrator as `/klopsi`, `@klopsi`, or `$klopsi`; these are agent-host forms, not shell commands. The skills use the installed CLI and do not add a model runtime or provider dependency to `klopsi`.

An installed CLI can also generate the same repertoire into a directory without installing it:

```sh
klopsi generate-skills
klopsi generate-skills --output-dir ~/.agents/skills --json
```

Agents use the same command surface as people and scripts. They should start with `--help`, request structured output, and keep results focused with field and row limits:

```sh
klopsi --help
klopsi search promet --fields id,title --json --limit 5
klopsi dataset show DATASET_ID --json
klopsi resource preview ./downloads/data.csv --limit 20 --json
```

For reliable agent workflows:

- Prefer `--json` or `--ndjson` over parsing human-readable tables.
- Use `--fields` and command-specific limits to keep context small and predictable.
- Read results from stdout, diagnostics from stderr, and use the process exit status for control flow.
- Pass `--offline` when the agent must not make network requests.
- Run `klopsi <command> --help` to inspect available arguments before constructing a command.

## Offline use

Warm the cache during an online run, then pass `--offline` or set `KLOPSI_OFFLINE=1`:

```sh
klopsi dataset list --refresh --json
klopsi dataset list --offline --json
KLOPSI_OFFLINE=1 klopsi resource preview opsi:resource:RESOURCE_ID --json
```

Offline commands never make network requests. Operations that require uncached metadata or content fail with a typed cache-miss error. Catalogue snapshots must remain valid and no more than 24 hours old.

## Security

Remote content is subject to HTTPS, DNS, redirect, timeout, and download-size controls. Bounded `klopsi query` operations run with DuckDB external access and extension loading disabled. DuckDB UI is an explicitly launched local exploratory environment and is outside that query sandbox; KLOPSI opens a writable invocation-local workbench with the staged dataset attached read-only. Downloads, conversions, and query exports publish atomically and record provenance.

Read the [security model](docs/security.md) and [security policy](SECURITY.md) before enabling network overrides or reporting a vulnerability.

## TypeScript SDK

The dependency-clean `klopsi/sdk` entry point exports `KlopsiClient`, `ProviderRegistry`, and public domain types. Supply a provider that implements the public `DataProvider` contract:

```ts
import { KlopsiClient, ProviderRegistry, type DataProvider } from "klopsi/sdk";

export function createClient(provider: DataProvider): KlopsiClient {
  const registry = new ProviderRegistry([provider]);
  return new KlopsiClient({
    registry,
    providerId: provider.descriptor.id,
  });
}
```

Provider and format extension contracts are documented in [provider development](docs/providers.md), [format development](docs/formats.md), and [architecture](docs/architecture.md).
